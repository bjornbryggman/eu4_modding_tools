Okay, let's move on to step 9 of the action plan: Optimization and Refactoring.

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Profiling:**
   - Use a profiling tool like `cProfile` or `line_profiler` to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
   - Run your code with a representative set of input files and analyze the profiling results to pinpoint areas for optimization.

2. **Database Optimizations:**
   - **Batch Operations:** Instead of performing individual database operations for each property or value, consider using batch operations to improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
   - **Indexing:** Ensure that you have appropriate indexes on the database tables to speed up queries.
   - **Query Optimization:** Analyze your database queries and optimize them for efficiency.

3. **Code Optimizations:**
   - **Regular Expression Optimization:** If you're using regular expressions extensively, analyze their performance and consider optimizing them for efficiency.
   - **Data Structures:** Choose data structures that are appropriate for the task and optimize for performance. For example, use dictionaries for fast lookups instead of lists.
   - **Avoid Unnecessary Operations:** Eliminate redundant calculations or operations to improve performance.

4. **Multiprocessing:**
   - Utilize multiprocessing to parallelize tasks that can be executed independently, such as file processing or database operations.

**Refactoring Strategies:**

1. **Code Structure:**
   - Refactor your code to improve readability and maintainability.
   - Consider using functions to encapsulate related logic and classes to organize your code.
   - Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable units.

2. **Naming Conventions:**
   - Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
   - Follow consistent naming conventions.

3. **Code Style:**
   - Adhere to a consistent coding style, such as PEP 8 for Python.
   - Use a code formatter like `black` to automatically format your code.

**Example Optimization (Database Batch Operations):**

```python
# Instead of individual operations:
# with Session(engine) as session:
#     for value in values:
#         original_value = OriginalValue(property_id=property_record.id, value=value)
#         session.add(original_value)
#     session.commit()

# Use batch operations:
with Session(engine) as session:
    original_values = [OriginalValue(property_id=property_record.id, value=value) for value in values]
    session.add_all(original_values)
    session.commit()
```

**Example Refactoring (Function Encapsulation):**

```python
# Before refactoring:
def calculate_scaling_factors(original_values, scaled_values):
    scaling = {}
    for prop in original_values:
        # ... calculation logic ...
    return scaling

# After refactoring:
def calculate_scaling_factors(original_values, scaled_values):
    scaling = {}
    for prop in original_values:
        scaling[prop] = _calculate_property_scaling(original_values[prop], scaled_values[prop])
    return scaling

def _calculate_property_scaling(original_prop_values, scaled_prop_values):
    # ... calculation logic ...
    return scaling_factor
```

**Next Steps:**

1. **Profile your code:** Identify performance bottlenecks.
2. **Implement optimizations:** Apply the strategies mentioned above to improve performance.
3. **Refactor your code:** Improve readability, maintainability, and structure.

By optimizing and refactoring your code, you can significantly improve the performance and maintainability of your scaling solution.
