# TODO: Write a README that doesn't suck.

**TLDR**:
A series of script for modifying the game files of Europa Universalis 4. The current functions mainly revolve around upscaling the vanilla game files for 2K and 4K resolutions, as well as a set of functions for generating unique terrain pictures for every province in the game (taking its attributes into account, e.g. climate, terrain, etc).

Planned features also include generating unique event pictures for every event in the game (in a similar fashion to the terrain pictures). I'd also like make it possible to generate not only event pictures, but entire event chains themselves. Being able to automatically produce unique and immersive events for every nation in the game would be really fun.

Might also make a set of functions for parsing the localization files and fixing typos, idk.

Will write a more detailed README as the project reaches version 1.0.
