## History
**User**
I have some digital art that I really like, and I want to know how to prompt images that look just like it. Naturally, the original artists will be given their due credit as well. How would you describe these images? Specifically, what style do they exhibit?


**OpenRouter**
This image exhibits a style that can be described as digital concept art or digital matte painting. It's a blend of fantasy and science fiction elements, with a strong emphasis on atmospheric perspective and environmental storytelling. Here are some key aspects of the style:

1. Atmospheric perspective: The image uses a layered approach to depth, with foreground, midground, and background elements becoming progressively hazier and bluer to create a sense of distance.

2. Color palette: It employs a predominantly cool color scheme with blues and teals, punctuated by warm accents of red and orange to create visual interest and contrast.

3. Lighting: Soft, diffused lighting is used throughout, with a bright sky and subtle highlights on the water surface.

4. Architectural elements: The cityscape features fantastical, towering structures with unique silhouettes, suggesting an advanced or magical civilization.

5. Natural elements: The image incorporates water, clouds, and vegetation to create a rich, lived-in world.

6. Texture: While the overall style is relatively smooth, there's a painterly quality to the clouds and water that adds depth and interest.

7. Scale: The image uses scale effectively to create a sense of grandeur, with small boats in the foreground contrasting with massive structures in the background.

8. Detail level: It balances areas of high detail (like the intricate sails of the boat) with broader, more impressionistic areas (like the distant city) to guide the viewer's eye.

To prompt for similar images, you might use terms like "digital concept art," "fantasy cityscape," "atmospheric perspective," "matte painting style," along with specific elements you want to include (e.g., "futuristic towers," "sailing ships," "misty harbor").

Alright, lets test it out. Write a prompt for a similar image that captures the same style, featuring a tall magic tower.


**OpenRouter**
Here's a prompt that aims to capture a similar style while featuring a tall magic tower:

"Digital concept art of a majestic, towering magical spire rising above a misty fantasy cityscape. Atmospheric perspective with layers of depth. Cool color palette dominated by blues and teals, with warm accents of purple and gold. Soft, diffused lighting with a bright, cloudy sky. Intricate architectural details on the tower, glowing with arcane energy. Surrounding buildings blend fantasy and futuristic elements. Foreground features a serene body of water with small boats and lush vegetation. Painterly textures in clouds and water. Epic scale contrasting the massive tower with smaller elements. Matte painting style with a balance of detailed and impressionistic areas. Magical particles or energy streams swirling around the tower's peak."

This prompt incorporates the key stylistic elements we identified, while focusing on a tall magic tower as the central feature. It should help generate an image with a similar feel to the one we discussed, but with its own unique magical focal point.

That was excellent! Now do the same thing again, but this time showing an idyllic countryside of farmlands. Also, remember that simplicity is key; no more than a single paragraph or the AI image generators lose focus.


**OpenRouter**
Certainly! Here's a simplified prompt for an idyllic countryside scene in the same style:

"Digital concept art of a serene, pastoral landscape with rolling farmlands. Golden wheat fields and vibrant green pastures stretch to the horizon. Soft, diffused lighting bathes the scene in a warm glow. A winding river in the distance reflects the sky, dotted with small boats. Atmospheric perspective creates layers of depth. Painterly style with a color palette of warm golds, soft greens, and cool blues. Wispy clouds drift across a vast sky."

Now do an image of a jungle, also don't include rivers in every prompt.


**OpenRouter**
Certainly! Here's a prompt for a jungle scene in the same style, without including a river:

"Digital concept art of a lush, mysterious jungle. Towering trees with massive canopies dominate the scene, dappled sunlight filtering through dense foliage. Vibrant greens blend with deep shadows, creating a sense of depth and secrecy. Exotic flowers in bright colors add pops of contrast. Misty atmosphere in the background suggests vast unexplored areas. Vines and hanging moss add texture. Subtle hints of hidden ruins or wildlife. Painterly style with rich, saturated colors and soft edges."

Excellent, now write a prompt for an image of drylands.


**OpenRouter**
Here's a prompt for an image of drylands in the same artistic style:

"Digital concept art of a stark, arid landscape at dusk. Cracked earth stretches to the horizon, painted in muted tones of ochre and sienna. Weathered rock formations and mesas rise dramatically against a vast sky filled with wispy clouds tinged pink and purple. Sparse, drought-resistant vegetation dots the foreground, adding touches of muted green. Heat distortion shimmers in the distance, creating a soft haze. A lone, gnarled tree stands silhouetted, emphasizing the harsh beauty. Painterly style with textured brushstrokes capturing the rugged terrain and expansive atmosphere."

Pine forests cling to lower slopes, adding dark green accents. Soft, diffused lighting bathes the scene in an ethereal glow. Painterly style with bold brushstrokes capturing the grandeur and scale of the mountains."

Here's a prompt for a sprawling, medieval urban city in the same artistic style:

"Digital concept art of a vast medieval cityscape at sunset. Towering Gothic spires and ornate cathedral domes dominate the skyline. Narrow, winding streets and crowded timber-framed buildings sprawl across rolling hills. Stone bridges span a wide river cutting through the city. Warm golden light bathes the scene, casting long shadows and glinting off windows. Smoke rises from chimneys, adding atmosphere. Bustling marketplaces and busy ports hint at city life. Surrounding city walls with guard towers emphasize the medieval setting. Painterly style with rich textures and a warm color palette, balancing detailed architecture with impressionistic distant elements."
