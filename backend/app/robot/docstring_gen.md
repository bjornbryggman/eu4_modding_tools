Generate images using a Hugging Face diffusion pipeline based on YAML settings.

Process:
-------
-------
    - Authenticates with Hugging Face using a provided token.
    - Extracts settings from the provided YAML configuration.
    - Sets up the diffusion pipeline based on the chosen model and settings.
    - Generates images for each prompt in the input parameters.
    - Encodes the generated images as Base64 strings and returns them along with their identifiers.

Args:
----
----
    - input_parameters (tuple[int | str, str]): A tuple of input parameters, where each element is a tuple containing an identifier and a prompt.
    - settings (dict[str, Any]): A dictionary containing settings for the diffusion pipeline, including model ID, inference steps, image dimensions, and guidance scale.

Returns:
-------
-------
    - tuple[int | str, str]: A tuple of results, where each element is a tuple containing an identifier and the Base64-encoded generated image.

Exceptions:
----------
----------
    - subprocess.CalledProcessError: Raised if Hugging Face authentication fails.
    - torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: Raised if a CUDA out-of-memory error occurs.
    - RuntimeError: Raised if an error occurs while setting up the diffusion pipeline.
    - ValueError: Raised if invalid configuration parameters are provided.
    - OSError: Raised if an error occurs while saving generated images.
    - Exception: Raised for any other unexpected errors during execution.
